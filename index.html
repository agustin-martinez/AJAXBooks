            With 32 case studies and examples from more than 85 companies this
            book shows why “Make Mom Proud” companies outperform their

            it provides a five-step guide to customer experience and culture
            transformation. Using comics and a “make-mom-proud-ometer” quiz this

            “The Wallet Allocation Rule”
          </h1>
          <span>by Timothy Keiningham, Lerzan Aksoy and Luke Williams</span>
          <img src="img/books/book3.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            Co-authored by none other than Qualtrics’ Principal, CX Strategy and
            Thought Leadership, Luke Williams, this book quickly became a New
            York Times Bestseller thanks to its revolutionary approach for
            linking brand perception and share of wallet. It addresses the fact
            that traditional metrics like NPS and CSAT have been hard to
            correlate with share of wallet and sets out a new approach that
            allows organizations to calculate the precise impact of brand
            positioning on the metric that matters most – how much consumers
            spend with your brand.

            It is often said that the customer is always right. Turns out the
            customer doesn’t want to be right as much as they want smooth
            service. Dixon and his colleagues at CEB challenge customer service
            norms and claim that loyalty is creating by proving consistent
            service, day-in, and day-out. In addition, they provide tools and
            templates to decrease churn, improve service, and reduce costs, so
            you can start implementing these principles into your business right
            away.

          <p>
            Based on several years' worth of exclusive interviews and
            unprecedented access to all three bands' personal archives, this is
            the first, definitive, biography of Coil, Current 93 and Nurse With
            Wound. Together, the bands represent the real English underground in
            all its sexual, cultural and artistic variety. A shadowy scene whose
            work accents peculiarities of Englishness through the links and
            affinities they've forged with earlier generations of outsiders.

          <p>
            Rip It Up and Start Again is the first book-length exploration of
            the wildly adventurous music created in the years after punk.
            Renowned music journalist Simon Reynolds celebrates the futurist
            spirit of such bands as Joy Division, Gang of Four, Talking Heads,
            and Devo, which resulted in endless innovations in music, lyrics,
            performance, and style and continued into the early eighties with
            the video-savvy synth-pop of groups such as Human League, Depeche
            Mode, and Soft Cell, whose success coincided with the rise of MTV.
